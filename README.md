## Inspiration
- I was inspired to create this project by my own genuine curiousity at how we have progressed in discovering exoplanets, which was surprisingly different than what I expected.
## Information
- The Exoplanet Data Visualizer is a small project, featuring an interactive graph with four different visualizations to help visualize how the discovery in exoplanets has changed through time, exemplifying how code can be used in statistics to make data more readable and understandable.
